This repository assembles the various SQL and Python projects I completed during my studies at Masterschool, as part of my professional transition from a British industrial R&D engineer to a Data Scientist.

Each project demonstrates different technical approaches and problem-solving methods. However, the most important aspect highlighted here is my industry-driven, out-of-the-box thinking, which consistently helped me optimize computation and memory usage while still achieving commercially required accuracy.
