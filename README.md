This repository assembles the various SQL/Python projects I completed during my studies at Masterschool, as part of my professional transition from a British industrial R&D engineer to a Data Scientist.

Each project demonstrates different technical approaches and problem-solving methods. However, the most important aspect highlighted here is my industry-driven, out-of-the-box thinking, which consistently helped me optimize computation and memory usage while still achieving commercially required accuracy.

The repository not only demonstrates my technical work, but also highlights my learning progression and growing confidence in Python and SQL.
